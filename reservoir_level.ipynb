    "A dam reservoir's capacity is 250e100 cubic metre where it holds 199.5e85 cu.m water.\n",
    "A rain occured in the area which gave 25e8 cu.m water but 25% amount of this rain water ran-off useless. \n",
    "The remaining water from this rainfall flowed to the reservoir and there it was collected. \n",
    "On another day, a heavy storm increased the water level of this dam to its 15% of the current water level.\n",
    "Ground water sources contributed 5% to reservoir's current level. \n",
    "5% of the present level of reservoir evaporated and later 15% amount of water was passed for irrigation to arid regions. \n",
